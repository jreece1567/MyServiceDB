      "description": "Ticketless parking is now in operation at Westfield Bondi Junction. By allowing you to park without the need for a paper ticket, parking will be quicker and easier than ever before. Parking rates below.</p>\r\n<p><strong> HOW IT WORKS </strong></p>\r\n<p>1. There is no boom gate at entry, so you can drive straight into the car park. There will be a digital clock displaying your time of entry - remember the time you entered as you will not be issued with a paper ticket.</p>\r\n<p>2a. Upon leaving the shopping centre, if your visit to the car park is within the 2 hours free parking period provided, proceed straight to the exit. The parking system will recognise your licence plate number and the boom gate will automatically open.</p>\r\n<p>2b. If your visit to the car park is over the 2 hours free parking period provided, head to one of the many pay stations, enter your licence plate number and pay the parking fee. Drive to the exit where the system will recognise your parking payment and the boom gate will open automatically. If you exit the centre, there must be 30 minutes between exit and re-entry in order to receive another ‘2 hours free parking’ period. </p><p>2c. Alternatively, you can register at <a href=\"https://www.westfield.com.au/parking\">parkwestfield.com.au</a> to have your parking fee automatically deducted from your credit card. </p>\r\n<p><strong> BENEFITS OF REGISTERING</strong></p><p> Save time, drive in and out without visiting the pay station. Simply register with your credit card and when you exit the car park after your stay, your parking fee will be automatically deducted from your card. Register at <a href=\"https://www.westfield.com.au/parking\">parkwestfield.com.au.</a></p> <p><strong> HOW DO I KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I HAVE LEFT? </strong></p><p> Check your entry time on the digital clock at each car park entry upon arrival. </p><p>During your visit you can check your elapsed parking time by typing your licence plate into one of the many pay stations and digital directories in the centre. </p><p> Full conditions of entry are displayed throughout the car park. <a href=\"https://www.westfield.com.au/parking/faqs\">FAQs</a>               <a href=\"https://www.westfield.com.au/parking/terms-conditions\">TERMS & CONDITIONS</a></p>\r\n</p><p><strong> PARKING RATES </strong></p><p>\r\nWestfield Bondi Junction offers up to 2 hours free parking.

      "description": "<p>Ticketless parking is now in operation at Westfield Doncaster. By allowing you to park without the need for a paper ticket, parking will be quicker and easier than ever before. See parking rates below.</p>\r\n<p><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>*FREE PARKING PROMOTION</strong><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>For a limited time only, you are eligible to receive an extra free hour&rsquo;s parking each time you visit Westfield Doncaster. See <a href=\"http://PARKWESTFIELD.COM.AU\" target=\"_blank\">parkwestfield.com.au</a> for details.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>\r\n<p>1. There is no boom gate at entry, so you can drive straight into the car park. There will be a digital clock displaying your time of entry - remember the time you entered as you will not be issued with a paper ticket.</p>\r\n<p>2a. Upon leaving the shopping centre, if your visit to the car park is within the 3 hours free parking period provided, proceed straight to the exit. The parking system will recognise your licence plate number and the boom gate will automatically open.</p>\r\n<p>2b. If your visit to the car park is over the 3 hours free parking period provided, head to one of the many pay stations, enter your licence plate number and pay the parking fee. Drive to the exit where the system will recognise your parking payment and the boom gate will open automatically. If you exit the centre, there must be 2 hours between exit and re-entry in order to receive another &lsquo;3 hours free parking&rsquo; period.</p>\r\n<p>2c. Alternatively, you can register at <a href=\"http://www.westfield.com.au/parking\">parkwestfield.com.au</a> to have your parking fee automatically deducted from your credit card.</p>\r\n<p><strong>BENEFITS OF REGISTERING</strong></p>\r\n<p>Save time, drive in and out without visiting the pay station. Simply register with your credit card and when you exit the car park after your stay, your parking fee will be automatically deducted from your card. Register at <a href=\"https://www.westfield.com.au/parking?jcgsr\">parkwestfield.com.au</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HOW DO I KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I HAVE LEFT?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Check your entry time on the digital clock at each car park entry upon arrival.</p>\r\n<p>During your visit you can check your elapsed parking time by typing your licence plate into one of the many pay stations and digital directories in the centre.</p>\r\n<p>Full conditions of entry are displayed throughout the car park.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.westfield.com.au/parking/faqs\">FAQs&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.westfield.com.au/parking/terms-conditions\">TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>PARKING RATES</strong></p>\r\n<p>Westfield Doncaster offers up to 3 hours free parking.

The unique structure, located on Level 1 in the High Fashion Precinct, will act as a gallery and retail space, for shoppers to view, engage and purchase fashion and accessories from a range of Australian designers. InHabit&rsquo;s first designer in residence was none other than Kym Ellery, with her eponymous label ELLERY; an undisputed leading light within the Australian fashion industry. Kym Ellery which launched InHabit with ELLERY&rsquo;s Resort 2015 collection, which received rave reviews both locally and internationally when unveiled in June. With a curated series of exciting retail concepts in place for 2015, each designer in residence will be in place for a maximum of six weeks. Dion Lee, Ginger and Smart, Bec &amp; Bridge and Kit &amp; Ace are all confirmed for residencies in 2015. InHabit was designed by Melbourne architect Matthew Herbert of award-winning architectural and design practice Herbert &amp; Mason.</p>",

      "description": "Ticketless parking is now in operation at Westfield Hurstville. By allowing you to park without the need for a paper ticket, parking will be quicker and easier than ever before.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong> *FREE PARKING PROMOTION</strong></p>\r\n<p>For a limited time only, you are eligible to receive an extra free hour’s parking each time you visit Westfield Hurstville. See <a href=\"https://www.westfield.com.au/parking\">parkwestfield.com.au</a> for details.</p> \r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong> HOW IT WORKS </strong></p><p>1. There is no boom gate at entry, so you can drive straight into the car park. There will be a digital clock displaying your time of entry - remember the time you entered as you will not be issued with a paper ticket.</p><p>2a. Upon leaving the shopping centre, if your visit to the car park is within the 3 hours free parking period provided, proceed straight to the exit. The parking system will recognise your licence plate number and the boom gate will automatically open.</p><p>2b. If your visit to the car park is over the 3 hours free parking period provided, head to one of the many pay stations, enter your licence plate number and pay the parking fee. Drive to the exit where the system will recognise your parking payment and the boom gate will open automatically. If you exit the centre, there must be 30 minutes between exit and re-entry in order to receive another ‘3 hours free parking’ period. </p><p>2c. Alternatively, you can register at <a href=\"https://www.westfield.com.au/parking\">parkwestfield.com.au</a> to have your parking fee automatically deducted from your credit card. </p><p><strong> BENEFITS OF REGISTERING</strong></p><p> Save time, drive in and out without visiting the pay station. Simply register with your credit card and when you exit the car park after your stay, your parking fee will be automatically deducted from your card. Register at <a href=\"https://www.westfield.com.au/parking\">parkwestfield.com.au.</a></p><p><strong> HOW DO I KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I HAVE LEFT? </strong></p><p> Check your entry time on the digital clock at each car park entry upon arrival. </p><p>During your visit you can check your elapsed parking time by typing your licence plate into one of the many pay stations and digital directories in the centre. </p><p> Full conditions of entry are displayed throughout the car park. <a href=\"https://www.westfield.com.au/parking/faqs\">FAQs</a>               <a href=\"https://www.westfield.com.au/parking/terms-conditions\">TERMS & CONDITIONS</a></p>\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong> PARKING RATES </strong></p><p>\r\nWestfield Hurstville offers up to 3 hours free parking.

Validate by scanning the barcode of your movie ticket at any Pay Station before returning to your car. Do it before the movie to avoid queues later.

However, if you enter after 6pm, there is no need to validate, as you park for free.</p>\r\n<p><strong> DISABILITY PERMIT </strong></p>\r\n<p> Disabled patrons must validate their valid permit at the Concierge Desk located on Level 1. If you register for Ticketless Parking, you can apply your Disability Parking Permit to your registration and you only have to visit Concierge once.</p>\r\n<p><strong> MAIN CARPARK ENTRANCES </strong></p>\r\n<p> The main car park entrances are located on The Avenue, Park Road, Rose St and Cross Street.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TERMS & CONDITIONS</strong></p>\r\n<p> Full conditions of entry are displayed throughout the car park. <br><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.westfield.com.au/parking/terms-conditions\">*Terms and Conditions Apply.</a></p>",

      "description": "Carpark Changes\r\n\r\nWestfield Mt Druitt has taken positive action to provide customers with increased convenience as the battle for parking continues to increase. Located adjacent to the local railway station at Mt Druitt, Westfield Mt Druitt has long accommodated the high number of commuters unable to find parking spaces in the adjacent council car park. Unfortunately, this has come at the cost of regular shopper’s convenience and ease of finding a car space in our carpark. \r\n\r\nIn an effort to find a balance for shoppers and all day parkers, Westfield Mt Druitt has begun security patrols of prime car spaces during the peak morning commuter period of 6.00am – 9.30am Monday to Friday, restricting access only to our shoppers and diverting all day parkers to underutilised areas of the car park.\r\n\r\nComplimentary parking available for all customers.\r\n</p>\r\nAt Westfield Mt Druitt, we offer FREE parking spaces for your entire day shopping at Westfield.\r\n\r\n</p>We also cater for Parents with Prams, Disabled Shoppers, Seniors and Express Parking, as well as shaded parking in the Coles carpark.\r\n\r\n</p>The main car park entrances are located on North Parade, Carlisle Avenue and Luxford Road.",

These years of experience helped Candace realize that the fashion industry thrives on promoting trends rather than personal style, which contradicted her own philosophy.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: white;\">Her belief that style is about enhancing and expressing one&rsquo;s inner and outer self, not about achieving a look dictated by fashion media, drove her to pursue a career in personal styling. As the longtime &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; resource for friends and acquaintances seeking fashion advice and the recipient of numerous &ldquo;Best Dressed&rdquo; awards in community publications, the transition was a natural fit.</span> <span style=\"background-color: white;\">Through personal styling, Candace strives to empower women to look and feel like the best version of themselves. The process is as rewarding for her as it is for her clients.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: white;\">Call for more information or to schedule a consultation.</span></p>",

To ensure a smooth journey to and from the centre, please note the temporary changes to Car Park access.\r\n<p>\r\nUntil late 2016, for cars visiting Westfield London, access to the centre car park is now via the A3220 West Cross Route only. There is currently no access to the car park via Wood Lane and no through traffic route between Wood Lane/ Ariel Way and the A3220 West Cross Route.\r\n<p>\r\nExiting the basement car park from Level -3 will be reduced from two lanes to one, which may cause minor delays for customers but we have taken measures to ensure that delays are as minimal as possible. \r\n<p>\r\nWe are very excited to have started the journey to delivering a further enhanced Westfield London and we thank you for your patience while these works are carried out.\r\n<p><b>\r\nPARKING TARIFFS</b><br>\r\n0 - 1 Hours: £2.90<br>\r\n1 - 2 Hours: £5.80<br>\r\n2 - 24 Hours: £8.00<p>\r\n<b>SMART PARKING</b>\r\n<p>\r\nSmart Parking is coming soon to Westfield London.

      "description": "Tax-free shopping is available at both Westfield shopping centres. Staff at the Travelex desks in each centre will help you fill out all of your tax forms in advance of getting to the airport. At Westfield London, the Ice Bureau will give you an immediate tax refund (conditions apply).\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Step 1:</b> When making a purchase in a participating store, ask the sales assistant for a tax refund voucher/receipt and complete the form in-store. You may then be able to claim a cash tax refund immediately at ICE Currency Exchange at Westfield London if your receipt has the Global Blue, Premier Tax Free or Tax Free Worldwide logo (although a small charge may be applied for this service). You must remember to keep your receipts as you will need to present the goods, receipts and completed documentation to border officials upon leaving the EU. Customers should note that there are alternatives to ICE International Currency Exchange.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Step 2:</b> If you cannot make a claim immediately, then you should present the goods, your passport, shop receipt and tax free form to Customs upon exiting the EU and have the refund form stamped.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Step 3:</b> Stamped forms may be mailed to the tax refund services provider in an envelope for a refund direct to credit cards or a bank account. Stamped forms may also be presented at participating currency exchange locations e.g. Travelex.\r\n<p>\r\nOur dedicated Concierge team have multilingual copies of guidance produced by the tax refund service provider, which are available for you to take away. Copies of HM Revenue & Customs notice 704/1, which contains detailed guidance on the refund process, can be downloaded as PDF documents as well as obtained from the Concierge team.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Concierge team can also advise you on which retailers partner with which tax refund service provider, and tell you the nearest location to obtain a cash refund. If you have any questions in advance, please contact us.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Important notes:</b>\r\n<p>\r\nYou must live outside of the EU to be entitled to a VAT refund and leave the EU by the third month following the month of purchase e.g. items purchased in January must be exported by 30th April that year. In order to be eligible for a VAT refund in Europe, you must reside outside the European Union. The following countries are members of the EU: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Terms and conditions may vary between retailers and tax refund service providers and some retailers may set their own conditions - for example, that you spend a minimum amount in one store on the same day. Please check individual retailers in advance.\r\n<p>\r\nRefunds are subject to status and cash refund as well as tax refund provider terms and conditions. Other refund methods and locations are available outside Westfield London.

Shop online with your favourite brands and your items will be delivered and ready for you to try on in our comfy fitting rooms. What's more, you can enjoy one hour of free parking* and complimentary refreshments. And if you're not happy with your purchase, you can return it directly from the CollectPlus lounge!\r\n<p>\r\n<b>How it works:</b>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter you've placed your online order, simply do the following:\r\n<p>\r\n1. For your delivery location, select CollectPlus and search for W12 7SL, then choose 'Westfield London'.\r\n<br>\r\n2. CollectPlus will then text or email you to confirm that your delivery is ready to pick up.\r\n<br>\r\n3. Pick up and try on your items in our dedicated lounge and changing rooms.\r\n<br>\r\n4. Return unwanted items right from the lounge if necessary.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>What the bloggers said about CollectPlus:</b>\r\n<p>\r\n\"Westfield London kindly invited myself and some other mega babe bloggers to test the waters on their CollectPlus service lounge. Linked with a bunch of online clothing shops such as ASOS, Very and Office (to name a few), you are able to order your delivery directly to the Westfield Collect Lounge where you can collect your items and try them on in a very snazzy private changing room. Even better, if it doesn't fit or you don't like it, you can return it on the spot. For you drivers out there, if using this service you are able to have one hour free parking too. Not too shabby, aye? I have to say I was impressed massively with the service and ease _ I was genuinely pleased with how easy it was.\"\r\n<p>\r\n<i>- Callie, from TheCornersOfTheCurve.com</i>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n*Terms and conditions. This offer is limited to CollectPlus customers who are collecting or dropping off an item via the CollectPlus Service operated from the Click and Collect Concierge Desk in Westfield London.  Participating customers will receive their first hour of parking free of charge with normal tariffs to apply thereafter.  This is a promotional offer and may be altered or withdrawn by Westfield at any time.  Usual Car Park Terms and Conditions also apply.\r\n",

Leena was amazing from the moment I met her to the moment we parted company. She'd read my questionnaire and had already eyed up a large number of outfits in a range of stores. I felt totally comfortable with her and ended up with such a beautiful selection of clothes that suited my budget. Leena is a real talent and has provided me not only with the most amazing attire for this weekend that I feel brilliantly confident in, but also with a new eye for fashion that I would have previously just walked past - all in the space of a couple of hours! I already look forward to working with her again, at least two or three times over the year to help me with me with my wardrobe. It was a real joy - much more enjoyable than the bore and chore that clothes shopping used to be. Thanks Leena, and Style Doctors! Highly recommended, and well worth that extra bit of dosh for all that you get out of it!\"\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Simon, Westfield Stratford</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\"Hi, I just wanted to say thank you to my personal stylist Elin for today. She is a credit to your organisation and I really felt that I got my monies worth. I have come away from today with some lovely clothes (well wardrobe really) as it included coats, belts and shoes and all within budget. A genuinely enjoyable shopping experience, and this from a man who does not normally enjoy shopping for clothes at all. Thanks again and I will be booking again in a couple of months.\"\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Andy, Westfield Stratford</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\"I just want to convey how satisfied I am with my Personal Shopping experience last Friday with Stephanie. I was a bit nervous, having flown in from Sweden, never done this sort of thing before and had no idea what to expect. Stephanie was so professional and full of energy that by the end of the day she had instilled me with a huge dose of self-confidence. Even when I came home and unpacked everything I knew that I will use every single piece of item that I bought.

Thank you for all your understanding and patience. It is true that I surely would not have the confidence to try the styles and colours you shown me without your encouragement. Your fashion and style knowledge is amazing and this together with your lovely manner and personality makes time spent with you a very special event.\"\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Theresa, Westfield Stratford </i>\r\n<p> \r\n\"Thank you so much Tanja for showing me how to step outside my comfort zone and try something new! I never thought I could shop so many brands! It felt so effortless and easy, unlike my previous shopping attempts. This will be my regular service for me, can’t rate it highly enough.\"\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Rhys, Westfield Stratford</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\"We wanted to treat ourselves to something different and didn’t know what to expect, shopping was daunting for my mum and I and we never seemed to get it right so we wanted a professional to show us something new. As soon as we met Tanja we were at ease,  she was warm and funny and provided such a wonderful experience from start to finish. We both felt special and love our new looks! Thank you Tanja we will see you again for another booking.\"\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Farrah and Shenaya,, Westfield Stratford</i>\r\n<p>\r\n",
